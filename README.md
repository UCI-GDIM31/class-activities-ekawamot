## Devlogs
### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

For today, I focused on setting everything up to be able to work on my assignments. I believe I've set up github and unity correctly and am now working on the assingment. 

### W3
For the question we got #3, the horror game method. We said that the method would be void because it doesn't need to return anything. The parameter it would take would be the player's sanity level, which could be a float or an int depending on how the developer wants to code it. 

1. For the Monobehavior and classes metaphor, we said that Monobehavior is a kind of class that can become a component, but not every class can become a component. Additionally, the methods and member variables are all within the classes, and can only be used by those classes. The metaphor we came up with is like Pokemon. Classes are like Pokemon as a whole, but only some Pokemon can be evolved (a monobehavior class). Each Pokemon has their own specific moveset, which is like the methods and member variables. 
2. I believe the balls get very white after bouncing too many times is because the RGB values are being multiplied each time. Since they have a max of 255, the R, G, and B values get multiplied higher and higher until they all reach 255, and an RGB value of 255, 255, 255 is a pure white.  


### W4
We sit at table 18. It's one of the tables on the left side of the classroom next to a TV. 
For line 17, the line is declaring the member variable isGrounded. It is a bool that's value is true. Line 28 is an if statement that sees if the player is hitting the space key and if the variable isGrounded is true. If they are both true, then the player's character is forced into the air (a jump) and isGrounded is changed to be false (line 32). Overall, that section of the code is used to make the player character jump.
